1. Created a form 
2. Pushed the form object to the json-server using POST method by using a service.
3. onNgInit() when page loads (the page refreshes on every form submit, as I am not performing e.preventDefault). I call the GET method from the JSON server and fetch the tasks.
4. Store the fetched object in the local state that is bound with the table render logic.
